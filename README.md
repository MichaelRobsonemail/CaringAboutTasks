 overview of how task management works within the application, considering the actions and processes required by both taskgiver and taskacceptor users:

Task Management Overview:

1. Login:
Users log in with their username, password, and role (taskgiver or taskacceptor).
Upon successful authentication, users are directed to their respective dashboards.

2. Dashboard:
Taskgiver Dashboard:
Taskgiver users see a list of tasks they have created.
Each task displays its status (initiated, pending, accepted).
Taskgiver users can create new tasks, assign them to taskacceptor users, and monitor their status.

taskacceptor Dashboard:
taskacceptor users view tasks assigned to them.
Each task shows its status (pending or accepted).
taskacceptor users can accept tasks, view task details, mark tasks as complete, and track deadlines.

3. Task Creation (Taskgiver):
Taskgiver users create new tasks by providing a name, description, and possibly an ETA.
Once created, tasks are saved and displayed as buttons on the taskgiver's dashboard.
Task details include options for assigning the task to taskacceptor users.

4. Task Assignment (Taskgiver):
Taskgiver users assign tasks to taskacceptor users from the dashboard.
This may involve selecting a user from a dropdown list or entering their username.

5. Task Acceptance (taskacceptor):
taskacceptor users accept tasks assigned to them from their dashboard.
Accepted tasks move from "pending" to "accepted" status.

6. Task Completion (taskacceptor):
After completing tasks, taskacceptor users mark them as complete on their dashboard.
Completed tasks are updated with a status indicating they are finished.

7. Task Details Viewing (Both Users):
Users can view detailed information about each task, including descriptions and deadlines.
This information is accessible by clicking on task buttons on the dashboard.

8. Deadline Tracking (taskacceptor):
taskacceptor users track task deadlines to ensure timely completion.
Dashboard displays ETA for each task, aiding in prioritization.
